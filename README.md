# MomAndPop

## Assembly frontend

* npm install
* gulp (with prototype1)

or

* gulp 2 (with prototype2)

### Notice

There are 2 realizations (prototypes) of frontend from sources  
`gulp prototype1 - build first prototype  
`gulp prototype2 - build second prototype  
I didn't merge my code with prototypes in sources for usability.  
All my services have been separated.

* gulp (npm install -g gulp)
